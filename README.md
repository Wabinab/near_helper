# NEAR Helper

Some NEAR helpers. Some are deprecated as they got integrated into near sdk. Others remains (although inside near sdk, but one prefer one's version for some reason). Others are helpers for conversions. 

If you have a better way of doing stuffs, or some suggestions for test that you think should pass but might fail, open up a request in github here: https://github.com/Wabinab/near_helper/issues
